# MATLAB and R code for reproducibility

This repository contains MATLAB and R scripts used to reproduce simulations, analyses, and supplementary checks associated with the paper:

A synthetic ERFVII-dependent circuit in yeast sheds light on the regulation of early hypoxic responses of plants

The code is provided to reproduce computational results and analyses reported in the paper and its supplementary information.
The scripts are intended for simulation and analysis reproducibility, not for final figure styling.

---

## Repository structure

- code/figures  
  MATLAB scripts reproducing main and supplementary figures

- code/analysis  
  R scripts for reviewer-requested statistical analyses

---

## Requirements

- MATLAB (with Optimization Toolbox and Statistics Toolbox where indicated)
- R (packages listed at the top of the R scripts)

Each script is self-contained and can be run independently.

---

## Notes

- One script generally corresponds to one figure or figure panel.
- Minimal comments are included for clarity; the scientific implementation is unchanged.
- Some scripts generate multiple plots where this reflects the original analysis workflow.
